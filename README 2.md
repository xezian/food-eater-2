### CONGRATULATIONS!
#### You have reached FOOD EATER!
#### Click [here](https://serene-lowlands-69590.herokuapp.com/) for the deployed version (thanks [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home))
#### I'm happy you made it here
### WHAT IS IT?
* FOOD EATER is a full stack web application (details below) that allows it's users to either submit a new food, or eat any food that nobody has already eaten.
### WHY DID YOU MAKE IT?
* This app was built more or less an excercise in creating a full-stack web application that that serves a website on it's front end which displays data that is persistently stored in a database (thanks [JawsDB](https://www.jawsdb.com/))
### TELL ME ABOUT THE TECH INVOLVED
* MySQL is used for relational database mapping with a homemade ORM
* Node.js is used for server side architecture
* Express server is used with Express Handlebars to deliver the front-end
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all used on the front end
### WHERE IS THIS GOING?
* If this very exciting and useful app left you wanting more, you won't have to wait long. 
* As soon as next week, expect updates allowing users more functionality and with a fully refactored app using sequelize in the place of my homemade ORM.
* On that note, I appreciate any feedback or communication about the app itself or (even better) my code, including any ideas about how I can improve either.
## As always, thanks for swinging by, 
## and hang in there.
