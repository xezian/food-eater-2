#### I'm happy you made it here
### WHAT IS IT?
* FOOD EATER 2 is a full stack web application (details below) that allows it's users to either submit a new food, or eat any food that nobody has already eaten.
### WHY DID YOU MAKE IT?
* This app was built more or less an excercise in migrating a full-stack web application from a homemade ORM to sequelize to allow more complex queries and associations to exist with the data
* FOOD EATER 2 serves a website on it's front end which displays data that is persistently stored in a database (thanks [JawsDB](https://www.jawsdb.com/))
### TELL ME ABOUT THE TECH INVOLVED
* MySQL is used for relational database mapping with sequelize.js
* Node.js is used for server side architecture
* Express server is used with Express Handlebars to deliver the front-end
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all used on the front end
### WHAT'S NEW IN FOOD EATER 2 (as opposed to the [original](https://serene-lowlands-69590.herokuapp.com/) FOOD EATER)
### WHERE IS THIS GOING?
* If this very exciting and useful app left you wanting more, you won't have to wait long. Please look through the rest of my GitHub and see where else my coding journey is taking me.
* On that note, I appreciate any feedback or communication about the app itself or (even better) my code, including any ideas about how I can improve either.
## As always, thanks for swinging by, 
## and hang in there.
